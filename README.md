irssi-pushover
==============

Plugin for irssi (a console based IRC client) to send push-notifications using pushover.net.

This allows you to be notified when someone messages/mentions you on IRC, 
when you're not online.

This fork adds cooldown functionality to reduce the number of notifications, especially while
having a conversation
